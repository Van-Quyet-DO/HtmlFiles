<h1>Webpage Heading (H1)</h1>

<p>
Raymond is now teaching how to write an HTML webpage.
</p>
<p>We could link to a webpage outside this webpage.<br>
  This is a <a href="http://home.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/">link (No. 1)</a> linking to Raymond's homepage. This link is an absolute link (linking to a webpage outside this webpage).<br>
  This is a <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/dsct4900/Table.html">link (No. 2)</a> linking to the next webpage to be taught. This link is a relative link  (linking to a webpage outside this webpage).</p>
<p>We could also link to a particular part within this webpage.<br>
  This is a <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/dsct4900/SimpleWebpage.html#ImageHeading">link (No. 3)</a> linking to the part with a heading called "Image Heading (H2)" within this webpage.<br>
  This is a <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/dsct4900/SimpleWebpage.html#ListHeading">link (No. 4)</a> linking to the part with a heading called "Ordered/Unordered List Heading (H3)" within this webpage.
  <br>
</p>
<p>Raymond is typing this HTML webpage with many spaces ("&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"). </p>


<h2><a name="ImageHeading">Image Heading (H2)</a></h2>

<p> We could include Raymond's image in this webpage. The image could be found as follows.
</p>

<img border="1" src="./A Webpage Title_files/raymond2.JPG" width="166" height="221">

<h3><a name="ListHeading">Ordered/Underordered List Heading (H3)</a></h3>

<p>
Raymond next will teach you how to use "ordered lists" and "unordered lists".
</p>


<p>
The following shows an example of an ordered list.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> This is the first ordered item.
  </li><li> This is the second ordered item.
  </li><li> This is the third ordered item.
</li></ol>

<p>
The following shows an example of an unordered list.
</p>

<ul>
  <li> This is the first unordered item.
  </li><li> This is the second unordered item.
  </li><li> This is the third unordered item.
</li></ul>
